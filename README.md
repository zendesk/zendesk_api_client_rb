## <a name="pulls"></a>Note on Patches/Pull Requests
1. Fork the project.
2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.
3. Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version
   unintentionally.
4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have
   your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can
   ignore when I pull)
5. Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
