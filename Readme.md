# Zendesk API Client

## API version support

This client **only** supports Zendesk's v2 API.  Please see our [API documentation](http://developer.zendesk.com) for more information.

## Additional Documentation

Additional documentation can be found on our [documentation site](https://zendesk-api.herokuapp.com/doc/index.html) and [wiki](https://github.com/zendesk/zendesk_api_client_rb/wiki).

## Important Notice

Version 0.0.5 brings with it a change to the top-level namespace. All references to Zendesk should now use ZendeskAPI.

## Installation

The Zendesk API client can be installed using Rubygems or Bundler.

### Rubygems

```sh
gem install zendesk_api
```

### Bundler

Add it to your Gemfile

    gem "zendesk_api"

and follow normal [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) installation and execution procedures.

## Configuration

Configuration is done through a block returning an instance of ZendeskAPI::Client.
The block is mandatory and if not passed, an ArgumentError will be thrown.

```ruby
require 'zendesk_api'

client = ZendeskAPI::Client.new do |config|
  # Mandatory:

  config.url = "<- your-zendesk-url ->" # e.g. https://mydesk.zendesk.com/api/v2

  config.username = "login.email@zendesk.com"

  # Choose one of the following depending on your authentication choice
  config.token = "your zendesk token"
  config.password = "your zendesk password"

  # Optional:

  # Retry uses middleware to notify the user
  # when hitting the rate limit, sleep automatically,
  # then retry the request.
  config.retry = true

  # Logger prints to STDERR by default, to e.g. print to stdout:
  require 'logger'
  config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)

  # Changes Faraday adapter
  # config.adapter = :patron

  # Merged with the default client options hash
  # config.client_options = { :ssl => false }

  # When getting the error 'hostname does not match the server certificate'
  # use the API at https://yoursubdomain.zendesk.com/api/v2
end
```

Note: This ZendeskAPI API client only supports basic authentication at the moment.

## Usage

The result of configuration is an instance of ZendeskAPI::Client which can then be used in two different methods.

One way to use the client is to pass it in as an argument to individual classes.

```ruby
ZendeskAPI::Ticket.new(client, :id => 1, :priority => "urgent") # doesn't actually send a request, must explicitly call #save
ZendeskAPI::Ticket.create(client, :subject => "Test Ticket", :comment => { :value => "This is a test" }, :submitter_id => client.current_user.id, :priority => "urgent")
ZendeskAPI::Ticket.find(client, :id => 1)
ZendeskAPI::Ticket.delete(client, :id => 1)
```

Another way is to use the instance methods under client.

```ruby
client.tickets.first
client.tickets.find(:id => 1)
client.tickets.create(:subject => "Test Ticket", :comment => { :value => "This is a test" }, :submitter_id => client.current_user.id, :priority => "urgent")
client.tickets.delete(:id => 1)
```

The methods under ZendeskAPI::Client (such as .tickets) return an instance of ZendeskAPI::Collection a lazy-loaded list of that resource.
Actual requests may not be sent until an explicit ZendeskAPI::Collection#fetch, ZendeskAPI::Collection#to_a, or an applicable methods such
as #each.

### Caveats

Resource updating is implemented by sending only the `changed?` attributes to the server (see `ZendeskAPI::TrackChanges`).
Unfortunately, this module only hooks into `Hash` meaning any changes to an `Array`not resulting in a new instance will not be tracked and sent.

```
zendesk_api_client_rb $ bundle console
> a = ZendeskAPI::Trackie.new(:tags => []).tap(&:clear_changes)
> a.changed?(:tags)
 => false
> a.tags << "my_new_tag"
 => ["my_new_tag"]
> a.changed?(:tags)
 => false
> a.tags += %w{my_other_tag}
 => ["my_new_tag", "my_other_tag"]
> a.changed?(:tags)
 => true
```

### Pagination

ZendeskAPI::Collections can be paginated:

```ruby
tickets = client.tickets.page(2).per_page(3)
next_page = tickets.next
previous_page = tickets.prev
```

Iteration over all resources and pages is handled by Collection#each_page

```ruby
client.tickets.each_page do |resource|
  # all resources will be yielded
end
```

If given a block with two arguments, the page is also passed in.

```ruby
client.tickets.each_page do |resource, page|
  # all resources will be yielded along with the page
end
```

### Callbacks

Callbacks can be added to the ZendeskAPI::Client instance and will be called (with the response env) after all response middleware on a successful request.

```ruby
client.insert_callback do |env|
  puts env[:response_headers]
end
```

### Resource management

Individual resources can be created, modified, saved, and destroyed.

```ruby
ticket = client.tickets[0] # ZendeskAPI::Ticket.find(client, :id => 1)
ticket.priority = "urgent"
ticket.attributes # => { "priority" => "urgent" }
ticket.save # Will PUT => true
ticket.destroy # => true

ZendeskAPI::Ticket.new(client, { :priority => "urgent" })
ticket.new_record? # => true
ticket.save # Will POST
```

### Side-loading

**Warning: this is an experimental feature. Abuse it and lose it.**

To facilitate a smaller number of requests and easier manipulation of associated data we allow "side-loading", or inclusion, of selected resources.

For example:
A ZendeskAPI::Ticket is associated with ZendeskAPI::User through the requester_id field.
API requests for that ticket return a structure similar to this:
```json
"ticket": {
  "id": 1,
  "url": "http.....",
  "requester_id": 7,
  ...
}
```

Calling ZendeskAPI::Ticket#requester automatically fetches and loads the user referenced above (`/api/v2/users/7`).
Using side-loading, however, the user can be partially loaded in the same request as the ticket.

```ruby
tickets = client.tickets.include(:users)
# Or client.tickets(include: :users)
# Does *NOT* make a request to the server since it is already loaded
tickets.first.requester # => #<ZendeskAPI::User id=...>
```

OR

```ruby
ticket = client.tickets.find(:id => 1, :include => :users)
ticket.requester # => #<ZendeskAPI::User id=...>
```

Currently, this feature is limited to only a few resources and their associations.
They are documented on [developer.zendesk.com](http://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/rest_api/introduction.html#side-loading-\(beta\)).

### Search

Searching is done through the client. Returned is an instance of ZendeskAPI::Collection:

```ruby
client.search(:query => "my search query") # /api/v2/search.json?query=...
client.users.search(:query => "my new query")  # /api/v2/users/search.json?query=...
```

### Special case: Custom resources paths

API endpoints such as tickets/recent or topics/show_many can be accessed through chaining.
They will too return an instance of ZendeskAPI::Collection.

```ruby
client.tickets.recent
client.topics.show_many(:verb => :post, :ids => [1, 2, 3])
```

### Special Case: Current user

Use either of the following to obtain the current user instance:

```ruby
client.users.find(:id => 'me')
client.current_user
```

### Special Case: Importing a ticket

Bulk importing tickets allows you to move large amounts of data into Zendesk.

```ruby
ticket = ZendeskAPI::Ticket.import(client, :subject => "Help", :comments => [{ :author_id => 19, :value => "This is a comment" }])
```

http://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/rest_api/ticket_import.html

### Attaching files

Files can be attached to ticket comments using either a path or the File class and will
be automatically uploaded and attached.

```ruby
ticket = ZendeskAPI::Ticket.new(client, :comment => { :value => "attachments" })
ticket.comment.uploads << "img.jpg"
ticket.comment.uploads << File.new("img.jpg")
ticket.save
```

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
1. Fork the project.
2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.
3. Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version
   unintentionally.
4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have
   your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can
   ignore when I pull)
5. Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
