# .git-blame-ignore-revs

# What is this file?

# To limit the impact of 'unimportant' bulk commits, like big a PR full of rubocop fixes, git 2.23 adds a new option to git blame.
# Using --ignore-rev, or this file, one can specify a commit to be ignored by git blame.
# Lines changed by the ignored commit will be attributed to the previous commit touching that line instead.
# This means that even after our bulk style change, we can get back a meaningful context for the 'real' changes to our code.

# How do I use it?

# The file should contain the full (40 character) commit hashes.
# Lines starting with a # are considered comments and can be used to explain what makes the given commit(s) unimportant.
# Commit order in the file is not important.
